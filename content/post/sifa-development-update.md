Exciting news, fellow gamers and crypto enthusiasts! 🎮 Our SIFA online game development is in full swing, and we're thrilled to share the latest progress on our infrastructure development. Here's a sneak peek at the smart contracts that have been finalized:

1. SIFA ERC20 Token: Our foundational ERC20 token is now live, with a total emission of 1 billion tokens! 💰
2. Faucet Contract: Test the waters with our Faucet, allowing users to claim 100 tokens daily on the testnet. Dive in and experience the SIFA token firsthand! 💦
3. Vault Contract: Lock and load your tokens in the Vault to receive emission rewards. In the future, the Vault will also distribute game revenue among depositors. 💼
4. Emitter Contract: With a whopping 800 million tokens under its belt, the Emitter contract will gradually release tokens over 10 years to the Vault, ensuring a steady flow of rewards to our dedicated participants. 📈
5. VestingVault Contract: Need a little patience? Our VestingVault contract ensures a fair release of tokens, with individual cliffs and release speeds tailored to each vester's needs. ⏳

We're paving the way for an immersive gaming experience intertwined with the power of decentralized finance. Join us on GitHub to test, improve, and contribute to our project: [SIFA GitHub Repository](https://github.com/sifagame)
