The testnet site is live at https://testnet.sifa.game

Testnet contracts are finalized and deployed to Arbitrum Sepolia: [SIFA Token](https://sepolia.arbiscan.io/token/0xb797da7f8a3f459f7f7c9e4b30950df16e1778f6), [Faucet](https://sepolia.arbiscan.io/address/0xd518acc72ee3f4dcbb21530d5d5eae5924951414), [Emitter](https://sepolia.arbiscan.io/address/0x228dc54dd68e5efe1374af380620ffb216572778), [Staking Vault](https://sepolia.arbiscan.io/address/0x0990eae56c962c8c5afae7d2bf3a94de6683da0a)

### Faucet
Go to https://testnet.sifa.game and claim your daily 100 SIFA from the Faucet. The requirements are simple: you should hold at least 0.001 Arbitrum Sepolia ETH in your test account. We do not charge for the test SIFA tokens in the Faucet. We require to have some ETH to prevent abusing the Faucet, that's all.

If you don't have SepoliaETH, search for Arbitrum Faucets in Google. Here are couple links which are working at the moment of this post:

### Emitter
Emitter holds the most part of SIFA tokens and will release it slowly across 120 epochs each of 30 days. The full emission then will be completed in 10 years. Anyone can withdraw available tokens from the Emitter. All tokens from Emitter will go to feed the Staking Vault.

We will start emission in a few days or weeks depending on the activity on the testnet. Just want to have enough participants to share the emission.

### Staking Vault
You can deposit your SIFA tokens to the Vault to buy shares. After the emission start, the vault will be filled with new tokens ans the share price will grow significantly. Please make sure to approve and deposit your tokens received from the Faucet. No one want's their assets to lay down with no profit.
