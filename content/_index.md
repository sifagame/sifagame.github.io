## The Story

Sifa [sifa:] was popular a Soviet schoolchild game after class or at recess. Often after the bell sounded, signaling the end of the lesson, someone in the class would shout: "Sifa!" And everyone would start throwing something dirty that would stain their clothes. Ideal for this was a rag for washing the blackboard (sifa). The task of the players was to dodge without letting themselves get hit, and if they did, the unlucky player got a dirty mark and became "contagious", now he had to get rid of the sifa as quickly as possible by hitting someone else with it.
